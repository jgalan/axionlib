A set of scripts used to test the magnetic field routines implemented in TRestAxionMagneticField.

### List of contents:

- **trilinear**: A set of ROOT-C macros allowing to generate a magnetic field from an analytical description, and validate the field trilinear interpolation.

- **magneticField.py**: Basic python validation tests on the magnetic field class.

- **fields.rml**: A common RML with magnetic field definitions.

- **boundary**: A set of ROOT-C macros allowing to generate a magnetic field volume and validate the calculation of intersection points between the particle trajectory and magnetic volume boundary planes.
